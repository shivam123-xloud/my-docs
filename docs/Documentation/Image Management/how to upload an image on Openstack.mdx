title: How to Upload an Image on OpenStack
description: Learn how to upload images to OpenStack using both CLI and XConnect Dashboard methods.
---

**-** There are two methods to upload images to OpenStack: using the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** or the **XConnect Dashboard**. Both methods allow you to upload custom images for VM creation.

---

## Method 1: Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Step 1: Log in to OpenStack CLI

Firstly, log in to your OpenStack CLI using the RC file.

<Info>
To learn how to access the OpenStack CLI, refer to the CLI access documentation.
</Info>

### Step 2: Upload the Image

Use the following command to upload the image to OpenStack:

```bash
openstack image create ImageName --file /path/to/image-file --disk-format raw --container-format bare --public --progress
```

<Image
  src="../images/image-upload/cli-upload.png"
  alt="CLI Image Upload"
  width="400"
/>

### **Example:**

```bash
openstack image create MyCustomImage --file /home/user/ubuntu-20.04.iso --disk-format raw --container-format bare --public --progress
```

### **Parameters Explained:**

<Steps>
  <Step><b>ImageName</b>: The name you want to give to the uploaded image</Step>
  <Step><b>--file /path/to/image-file</b>: The path to the image file that you want to upload</Step>
  <Step><b>--disk-format raw</b>: The disk format of the image</Step>
  <Step><b>--container-format bare</b>: The container format of the image (typically bare unless you have a specific container format)</Step>
  <Step><b>--public</b>: Makes the image accessible to all users in the OpenStack project</Step>
  <Step><b>--private</b>: Restricts access to only the user who uploads the image</Step>
  <Step><b>--progress</b>: Shows the progress of the image upload</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Navigate to Images

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to <b>Compute → Images</b>
   ![22](/Documentation/images/image-management/22.png)</Step>
 
  <Step>Click on the <b>Create Image</b> button 
  ![23](/Documentation/images/image-management/23.png)</Step>
  
</Steps>

### Step 3: Provide Image Details

Fill in the necessary details:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Name</b>: Enter a name for the image</Step>
  <Step><b>Image File</b>: Select the file you want to upload</Step>
  <Step><b>Format</b>: Choose the format of the image</Step>
  <Step><b>Visibility</b>: Select the visibility option (Private, Protected, Public)
  ![44](/Documentation/images/image-management/44.png)</Step>
</Steps>

**Visibility Options:**
- **Private**: Only you can access the image
- **Shared**: Specific users/projects can access the image  
- **Community**: All users in the OpenStack environment can access the image

### Step 4: Upload the Image

<Steps>
  <Step>Click on the <b>Create Image</b> button to upload the image
   ![45](/Documentation/images/image-management/45.png)</Step>
  <Step>Wait for the upload progress to complete</Step>
  <Step>Verify the image appears in the Images list</Step>
</Steps>

<Image

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Choose the right format:** Use RAW format for best performance, or QCOW2 for space efficiency.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Check file size limits:** Large images may take considerable time to upload. Ensure stable network connection.
</Warning>

### **Recommended Image Formats:**
- **RAW**: Fastest performance, larger file size
- **QCOW2**: Space-efficient, slightly slower performance
- **VHD**: Good for Windows images
- **VMDK**: Compatible with VMware environments

### **Visibility Guidelines:**
- **Use Private** for testing or personal images
- **Use Protected** for organization-specific images
- **Use Public** for commonly used base images

## Verify Image Upload

After uploading, verify your image:

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to <b>Compute → Images</b></Step>
  <Step>Check the image status is <b>Active</b></Step>
  <Step>Verify image size and format details</Step>
  <Step>Test by creating a VM from the uploaded image</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Images must be in "Active" status before they can be used to create virtual machines.
</Info>

## Image Successfully Uploaded

Your custom image is now available in OpenStack and ready to be used for creating virtual machines with your specific configuration and software requirements.
