## What is a Virtual Machine?

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** or **Instance** is a virtual computer that runs on cloud infrastructure.\
It enables users to deploy and manage applications without owning physical hardware.

- **Subnet**: Logical division of an IP network for segmentation and efficient IP management
- **ILL (Internet Leased Line)**: Dedicated high-speed connectivity to external networks

### Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Under the **Details** tab:

- **Instance Name**: Enter the VM name
- **Description**: Optional
- **Count**: Number of instances to create (ensure sufficient quota)

---

### Step 4: Select Source (OS & Volume)

Switch to the **Source** tab:

- **Create New Volume** → Select **YES**
- **Volume Size (GiB)** → Enables OS disk expansion
- **Delete Volume on Instance Delete**
  - YES → Deletes volume with VM
  - NO → Retains volume
- Select the **Operating System Image**

<info>
  Always select <strong>Create New Volume = YES</strong>
  to allow future OS disk expansion.

### Step 5: Choose Flavor

Switch to the **Flavor** tab:

- Select a **Flavor** (CPU and RAM configuration)

---

### Step 6: Configure Network

Switch to the **Networks** tab:

- Select both:
  - **ILL**
  - **Subnet**

<success>
  Selecting both ILL and Subnet helps avoid router creation and saves IP cost.
</success>

### Step 7: Configure Security Group

Switch to **Security Groups** tab:

- Default security group is selected automatically
- Use the arrow icon to select a custom security group

<warning>
  To create a new security group, refer to the <strong>"Security Group Creation"</strong>

### Step 9: Launch the Instance

Click **Launch Instance** to create the VM.

---

### Step 10: Verify VM Creation

Navigate to:

**Project → Compute → Instances**
