## What is a Virtual Machine?

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** or **Instance** is a virtual computer that runs on cloud infrastructure.  
It enables users to deploy and manage applications without owning physical hardware.

- **Subnet**: Logical division of an IP network for segmentation and efficient IP management  
- **ILL (Internet Leased Line)**: Dedicated high-speed connectivity to external networks

### Step 4: Select Source (OS & Volume)

Switch to the **Source** tab:

- **Create New Volume** → Select **YES**
- **Volume Size (GiB)** → Enables OS disk expansion
- **Delete Volume on Instance Delete**
  - YES → Deletes volume with VM
  - NO → Retains volume
- Select the **Operating System Image**

<Callout type="info">
Always select <strong>Create New Volume = YES</strong> to allow future OS disk expansion.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Choose Flavor

Switch to the **Flavor** tab:

- Select a **Flavor** (CPU and RAM configuration)

### Step 6: Configure Network

Switch to the **Networks** tab:

- Select both:
  - **ILL**
  - **Subnet**


![Configure networking](./images/creating-vm/7.png)


<Callout type="success">
Selecting both ILL and Subnet helps avoid router creation and saves IP cost.
</Callout>

### Step 7: Configure Security Group

Switch to **Security Groups** tab:

- Default security group is selected automatically
- Use the arrow icon to select a custom security group

### Step 8: Select Key Pair

Switch to **Key Pair** tab:

- Select your key pair using the arrow
