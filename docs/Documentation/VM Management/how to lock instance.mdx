## What is Instance Locking?

The **"Lock instance"** option allows you to lock an instance to prevent any further actions or modifications on that instance. When an instance is locked, it becomes **read-only**, meaning you cannot perform any operations that could potentially modify its state or configuration.

## What Does Locking Restrict?

Applying a lock to an instance restricts several operations:

### **🚫 Restricted Operations:**
- **Change instance state** (pause, suspend, reboot)
- **Resize resources** (CPU, memory, storage)
- **Perform live migrations**
- **Attach or detach volumes**
- **Modify security groups**
- **Update instance configuration**

### **✅ Allowed Operations:**
- **Access logs and monitoring information**
- **View instance details and status**  
- **Review configuration settings**
- **Monitor performance metrics**

<Warning>
The lock keeps the instance in a read-only state. No configuration or state changes can be made until the lock is removed.
</Warning>

## When to Use Instance Locking

**Lock instances when:**
- **Production systems** require change control
- **Critical workloads** need protection from accidental modifications
- **Maintenance windows** are scheduled  
- **Compliance requirements** demand immutable infrastructure
- **Shared environments** need access restrictions

**Common use cases:**
- Database servers during backup operations
- Web servers during traffic spikes
- Development instances during testing phases
- Critical applications with strict SLAs
