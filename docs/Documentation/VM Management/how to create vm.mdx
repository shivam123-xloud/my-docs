title: How to Create a VM
description: Step-by-step guide to create a Virtual Machine in Xloud Portal.
---


## What is a Virtual Machine?

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** or **Instance** is like a virtual computer that runs on the cloud. It allows users to deploy and run applications on virtualized infrastructure without needing physical hardware.

- **Subnet**: A logical division of an IP network range, allowing for network segmentation and efficient IP address management
- **ILL (Internet Leased Line)**: A dedicated, high-speed connection that provides connectivity between a system and external networks or the Internet

<Info>
To know how to create a subnet, please refer to the subnet creation guide.

## Step 1: Log in to the Portal

Log in to the <a href="https://portal-del.xloud.tech/auth/login/?next=/" target="_blank">xconnect portal</a>  using your credentials

![1](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/1.png)

## Step 2: Navigate to Instances

Follow the navigation path:

`Project → Compute → Instances`

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to the <b>Project</b> tab</Step>
  <Step>Open the <b>Compute</b> section</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>Instance</b></Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Launch Instance

<Steps>
  <Step>Click on <b>Launch Instances</b></Step>
</Steps>

![3](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/3.png)

---

## Step 4: Configure Instance Details

Under the **Details** tab, specify Instance/VM parameters:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Instance Name</b>: Assign a name to the virtual machine</Step>
  <Step><b>Description</b>: Optional description for the VM</Step>
  <Step><b>Count</b>: If you want to create more than 1 instance, input desired number</Step>
</Steps>

![4](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/4.png)
<Warning>
Make sure you have ample quota to create new instances.
</Warning>


---

## Step 5: Configure Source

Switch to the **Source** tab:

<Steps>
  <Step>Select <b>Boot Source</b>: Image</Step>
  <Step>In <b>Create New Volume</b> option: Select <b>YES</b></Step>
  <Step>Specify the <b>Volume Size (GiB)</b></Step>
  <Step>Choose <b>Delete Volume on Instance Delete</b> option</Step>
  <Step>Select the <b>Operating System/Image</b> from the list</Step>
</Steps>

![5](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/5.png)
<Info>
Select <b>YES</b> for Create New Volume - this allows you to expand your OS drive dynamically after VM deployment. If you select <b>No</b>, the OS will load in fixed size storage.
</Info>

<Note>
You can choose to delete the volume when you delete the VM, or keep the volume after VM deletion by selecting the appropriate option.
</Note>

## Step 6: Select Flavor

Switch to the **Flavor** tab:

<Steps>
  <Step>Select the preset for the VM to launch.</Step>
</Steps>
![5](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/5.png)
<Info>
A flavor is a preset configuration that defines the compute & memory of a VM.
</Info>



---

## Step 7: Configure Networks

Switch to the **Networks** tab:

<Steps>
  <Step>Select both <b>ILL</b> & <b>Subnet</b></Step>
</Steps>
![7](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/7.png)

<Tip>
Selecting both ILL & Subnet will help you save an IP cost which is associated with creating a router.
</Tip>

## Step 8: Configure Security Groups

Switch to the **Security Groups** tab:

<Steps>
  <Step>Default security group is selected by default</Step>
  <Step>Select your security group by clicking the arrow up sign</Step>
</Steps>
![8](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/8.png)

<Info>
Security groups are collection of network access rules that are used to limit the types of traffic that have access to instances.
</Info>

<Note>
To create a security group, please refer to the security group creation guide.
</Note>

## Step 9: Select Key Pair

Switch to the **Key Pair** tab:

<Steps>
  <Step>Select your key pair by clicking on the arrow up sign</Step>
</Steps>


### **Don't Have a Key Pair?**

A **Key Pair** is a security feature used for secure authentication and access to virtual instances. A key pair works like a digital lock and key. The **lock (public key)** is used to secure a virtual instance, and the **key (private key)** is kept secret and used to unlock and access the instance securely.

#### **Step 1: Log in to Portal**

Log in to the xconnect portal.
![1](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/1.png)

#### **Step 2: Create Key Pair**

<Steps>
  <Step>Under the <b>Project</b> tab, open the <b>Compute</b> tab</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>Key Pairs</b></Step>
</Steps>

Specify Key Pair parameters:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Key Pair Name</b>: Assign a name to the Key Pair</Step>
  <Step><b>Key Type</b>: Select key type (i.e., SSH Key or X509 certificate)</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>Create Key Pair</b></Step>
</Steps>
![9](/Documentation/images/creating-vm/9.png)

<Info>
After creating a key pair, the private key is automatically generated and downloaded to your system.
</Info>

<Warning>
It is important to securely store this automatically downloaded private key file as it grants access to the instances associated with the key pair.
</Warning>

After creating Key Pair, you can locate it under **Project** tab → **Compute** tab → **Key Pairs**.

#### **Step 3: Connect to VM Using Key**

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Open terminal or command prompt</b> on your local machine</Step>
  <Step><b>SSH into the VM</b> using the private key file:</Step>
</Steps>

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private_key.pem username@VM_IP_address
```

**Replace:**
- `/path/to/private_key.pem` with the actual path to your private key file
- `username` with the appropriate username for the VM  
- `VM_IP_address` with the IP address or hostname of the VM

#### **First Connection Warning**

If this is the first time you connect to a VM, you will see a warning:

```
The authenticity of host '122.184.75.211 (122.184.75.211)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PoaSwqxRc8g6iOXtiH7ayGHpSN0MXwUfWHkGgpLELJ8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

<Steps>
  <Step>Type <b>yes</b> in the terminal and press Enter</Step>
</Steps>


<Tip>
Once you successfully establish the SSH connection, a new window will open, granting you access to the VM environment.
</Tip>

## Step 10: Launch the Instance

<Steps>
  <Step>Click on <b>Launch Instance</b> to launch the desired instance</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 11: Verify VM Creation

To locate your created VM:

`Project → Compute → Instances`

Your VM will be available for use and can be accessed and managed through the dashboard.
