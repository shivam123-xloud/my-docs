## What is Volume Restoration?

Volume restoration refers to the process of recovering a volume from either a snapshot or backup. 

- **Snapshot**: A point-in-time copy of the volume's data, including its configuration, files, and settings
- **Backup**: A full copy of the volume's data, typically including all its contents and attributes
