## What is Volume Backup?

A **Backup** of a volume refers to a complete copy of the volume's data that is stored in a separate location from where snapshot is saved. Unlike snapshots, backups provide a fully independent copy of your volume data.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Complete Copy** - A full duplication of all volume data
- **Separate Storage** - Stored in a different location than snapshots
- **Recovery** - Can be used to restore volume data at any point in time
- **Data Protection** - Provides additional redundancy and protection against data loss
