## What is Volume Attachment?

Volume attachment refers to the process of associating or linking a storage volume with a specific virtual machine (VM). This allows the VM to access and use the storage capacity provided by the attached volume.

**Key points:**
- **Access** - Once attached, the VM can read and write data to the volume
- **Flexible** - Volumes can be attached and detached from VMs as needed
- **Portable** - A volume can be moved from one VM to another
- **Persistent** - Data remains on the volume even when detached from a VM

### Step 4: Detach Volume from Current VM

Click on **Manage Attachments**, then select the **"Detach Volume"** option to detach the volume from the current VM. This will initiate the process of removing the volume from the current VM, allowing you to move it to another VM.

<Note>
  The volume will be safely detached and all data will be preserved. The volume can now be attached to another VM.
</Note>

### Step 5: Attach Volume to Another VM

Repeat the following steps to attach the volume to a different VM:

<Steps>
  <Step>Click on <b>Manage Attachments</b> for the detached volume</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>"Select an instance"</b> to choose another VM</Step>
  <Step>Select the desired VM</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>"Attach Volume"</b> to attach the previously detached volume to the new VM
  ![51](/Documentation/images/image-management/51.png)</Step>
</Steps>

Once a volume is successfully attached to another VM, you will typically see the name of the new VM listed under the **"Attached To"** section of the volume details.

## Important Considerations

<Note>
  Ensure that the source VM is not actively writing to the volume when detaching it to prevent data corruption. After attaching a volume to a new VM, you may need to initialize the file system or mount the volume within the operating system.
