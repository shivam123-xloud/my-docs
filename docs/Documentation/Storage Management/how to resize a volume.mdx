## What is Volume Resizing?

When you resize a volume, you're essentially making it bigger to hold more data and work more efficiently. This can be helpful when you need more storage space for your files or when you want to improve the performance of your applications.

**Key points:**
- **Expansion only** - You can only increase the size of a volume, not decrease it
- **Non-disruptive** - Can be done on volumes that are attached to running VMs
- **Flexible** - Adjust storage capacity as your needs grow
- **Immediate** - Size increase is applied quickly to the system

## Step 6: Confirm the Extension

To finalize the process, click on the **"Extend Volume"** button.

This action will initiate the process of increasing the size of the selected volume. You can access the extended volume in your VM (if attached).

## Post-Resize Configuration

Once you have resized a volume that is attached to your VM, you may need to extend the volume in the Disk management tool within your operating system to recognize and utilize the additional space.

<Note>
  The storage space is immediately available at the hypervisor level, but your operating system may need additional configuration to recognize and use the newly added capacity.
