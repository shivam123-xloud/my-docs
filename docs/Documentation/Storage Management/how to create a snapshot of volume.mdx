## What is a Volume Snapshot?

A **Snapshot** is like taking a picture of your volume's data at a specific moment. It acts as a backup, capturing the exact state of the data on the volume at that time.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Point-in-time capture** - Snapshot preserves the exact state of your volume at the time of creation
- **Size based on data** - The snapshot size is determined by the amount of data present on the volume
- **Backup capability** - Use snapshots to protect against data loss or accidental deletions
- **Cloning source** - Snapshots can be used as a source to create new volumes

### **Common Snapshot Use Cases**

- **Data backup** - Regular snapshots for disaster recovery
