## What are Router Interfaces?

**Router Interfaces** allow you to connect multiple networks to a single router, enabling communication between different network segments. Each interface represents a connection point where different networks can be attached to the router.

**Key benefits:**
- **Multi-network connectivity** - Connect different subnets and VLANs through one router
- **Traffic routing** - Enable communication between isolated network segments  
- **Centralized management** - Manage multiple network connections from single router
- **Flexible topology** - Create complex network architectures as needed

## Step 3: Select Existing Router

<Steps>
  <Step>Select the name of desired <b>existing router</b> from the list</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Ensure you have an existing router with gateway configured before adding interfaces.

## Step 5: Add Network Interface

<Steps>
  <Step>Select one of the <b>interfaces/networks</b> you want to connect</Step>
  <Step>Configure any additional interface settings if required</Step>
  <Step>Confirm the interface addition</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Each interface represents a network that will be connected through this router.

## Step 6: Repeat for Additional Interfaces

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Repeat Step 5</b> to add all the desired interfaces you want to connect</Step>
  <Step>Verify all interfaces are properly connected</Step>
  <Step>Check interface status shows as <b>Active</b></Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can add multiple interfaces to enable communication between different networks through the same router.

## Interface Management Best Practices

### **Planning Network Connections:**
- **Map network topology** before adding interfaces
- **Identify required subnets** that need interconnectivity  
- **Plan IP addressing** to avoid conflicts between networks
- **Consider traffic flow** between connected networks

### **Security Considerations:**
- **Review network isolation** requirements before connecting
- **Implement security groups** to control inter-network traffic
- **Monitor traffic patterns** after connecting interfaces
- **Document network connections** for troubleshooting

<Warning>
Connecting multiple interfaces can create security implications. Ensure proper firewall rules and security groups are in place.
</Warning>

## Common Interface Connection Scenarios

### **Multi-Tier Application:**
- **Web tier subnet** → Router interface
- **Application tier subnet** → Router interface  
- **Database tier subnet** → Router interface
- **Benefit**: Controlled communication between application layers

### **Development Environment:**
- **Development subnet** → Router interface
- **Testing subnet** → Router interface
- **Staging subnet** → Router interface
- **Benefit**: Isolated environments with shared services access

### **Hybrid Cloud Setup:**
- **Private subnet** → Router interface
- **Public subnet** → Router interface
- **Management subnet** → Router interface
- **Benefit**: Flexible connectivity for different workload types

<Tip>
Start with essential connections and add interfaces incrementally based on actual communication requirements.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Interface Connections

### **Common Issues:**
- **Interface not appearing**: Check network availability and permissions
- **Connectivity problems**: Verify routing tables and security groups
- **IP conflicts**: Ensure subnet ranges don't overlap
- **Performance issues**: Monitor bandwidth and routing efficiency

### **Verification Steps:**
<Steps>
  <Step>Check interface status in router details</Step>
  <Step>Verify network connectivity between subnets</Step>
  <Step>Test traffic flow with ping/traceroute</Step>
  <Step>Review router and network logs for errors</Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple Interfaces Successfully Connected

Your router now connects multiple networks, enabling communication between different network segments while maintaining centralized routing control and management.
