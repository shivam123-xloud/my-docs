## What is a Subnet?

A **Subnet** is a subdivision of an IP network range that allows you to define a smaller, manageable portion of IP addresses within a larger network.

**Key characteristics:**
- **IP address subdivision** - Divides larger network into smaller segments
- **Network management** - Provides organized and efficient IP address allocation
- **Resource isolation** - Enables logical separation of network resources
- **DHCP support** - Supports automatic IP address assignment and network configuration
- **Gateway routing** - Controls network traffic routing and access

## Step 2: Navigate to Networks

Follow the navigation path:

`Project → Network → Networks`

<Steps>
  <Step>On the <b>Project</b> tab, open the <b>Network</b> tab</Step>
  <Step>From the dropdown menu, click on <b>Networks</b>
  ![62](/Documentation/images/network-management/62.png)</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Create a Network

<Steps>
  <Step>Click on <b>Create Network</b> button
  ![63](/Documentation/images/network-management/63.png)</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Configure Network Parameters

Enter the following network parameters:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Network Name</b>: Specify a name to identify the network</Step>
  <Step><b>Admin State</b>: Select this check box to enable the network</Step>
  <Step><b>Create Subnet</b>: Select this check box to create a subnet along with the network
  ![64](/Documentation/images/network-management/64.png)</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Enabling the Admin State immediately makes the network available for use. Creating a subnet at the same time streamlines the network setup process.
</Info>

## Step 5: Define Subnet Parameters

Go to the **Subnet** tab and specify the following subnet parameters:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Subnet Name</b>: Specify a descriptive name for the subnet</Step>
  <Step><b>Network Address</b>: Specify the IP address for the subnet in CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24 where the prefix is the binary representation of the network address and the suffix declares the total number of bits in the entire address)</Step>
  <Step><b>IP Version</b>: Select <b>IPv4</b> for Internet Protocol version 4</Step>
  <Step><b>Gateway IP</b>: A gateway IP refers to a device on a network which sends local network traffic to other networks. To use the default gateway, leave this field blank

</Steps>

<details>
<summary><b>📋 CIDR Notation Examples - Click to Expand</b></summary>

**Common CIDR Ranges:**
- **10.0.0.0/24** - 254 usable addresses (small networks, development)
- **10.0.0.0/22** - 1022 usable addresses (medium networks, production)
- **10.0.0.0/20** - 4094 usable addresses (large networks, enterprise)
- **10.0.0.0/16** - 65534 usable addresses (very large networks)

</details>

<Tip>
Plan your CIDR notation carefully during the design phase to ensure you have enough IP addresses for current needs and future growth.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Configure Subnet Details

Switch to the **Subnet Details** tab to configure additional settings:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Enable DHCP</b>: Select this check box to enable DHCP</Step>
  <Step><b>Allocation Pool</b>: Define the range of IP addresses to be assigned by DHCP (optional, uses default range if not specified)</Step>
  <Step><b>DNS Name Servers</b>: Specify the DNS server names for name resolution. Common options include: Google DNS (8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4), Airtel DNS (202.56.230.2 202.56.230.7), or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1)
  ![66](/Documentation/images/network-management/66.png)</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the subnet, making network configuration easier and more efficient without manual IP assignment.
</Info>

## Step 7: Finalize Subnet Creation

<Steps>
  <Step>Review all configuration details</Step>
  <Step>Click on the <b>Create</b> button to finalize the process
  ![67](/Documentation/images/network-management/67.png)</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Take a moment to verify all settings before clicking Create. Once created, some settings like CIDR notation cannot be easily changed.
</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Verify Subnet Creation

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate back to <b>Project → Network → Networks</b></Step>
  <Step>Locate your newly created subnet in the list</Step>
  <Step>Verify the subnet status and configuration details

## Subnet Configuration Best Practices

**Network Planning Considerations:**
- **CIDR notation** - Choose appropriate subnet mask for your resource needs
- **IP addressing** - Plan for current usage plus future growth
- **Gateway configuration** - Use default or custom gateway based on network requirements
- **DNS resolution** - Select reliable DNS servers for name resolution
- **DHCP settings** - Configure appropriate allocation pools to avoid address conflicts

**Common Subnet Scenarios:**

*Development Environment:* Network 10.0.0.0/24 with 254 usable IP addresses, DHCP enabled for development and testing.

*Production Environment:* Network 10.0.0.0/22 with 1022 usable IP addresses, DHCP enabled with managed pools for business-critical applications.

*Large Enterprise:* Network 10.0.0.0/16 with 65534 usable IP addresses, DHCP enabled with segmented pools for multi-department deployments.

<Warning>
Plan your subnetting strategy in advance. Hasty or incorrect subnet configuration can lead to connectivity issues and operational challenges.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once you have created a subnet, you can:

<Steps>
  <Step>Create and configure routers to provide internet access</Step>
  <Step>Attach network interfaces to instances within the subnet</Step>
  <Step>Configure security groups for traffic control and isolation</Step>
  <Step>Launch virtual machines within the subnet</Step>
</Steps>

For instructions on how to create routers and connect to your subnet, refer to the [How to Create a Router guide](router).

## Subnet Successfully Created

Your network subnet is now configured and ready for use. Instances launched within this subnet will automatically receive IP addresses and network configuration based on your DHCP and DNS settings.
