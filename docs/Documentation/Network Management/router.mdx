## What is a Router?

A **Router** in networking is used for **interconnectivity of different networks** and for the **connection of instances to the internet**. It acts as a gateway that enables communication between your private network and external networks.

**Key functions:**
- **Internet connectivity** - Provides external network access for instances
- **Network routing** - Routes traffic between different network segments
- **Gateway services** - Acts as entry/exit point for network traffic
- **Interface management** - Connects multiple network interfaces

### Step 4: Configure Router Details

Enter the following configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step><b>Name</b>: Enter a descriptive name for the router</Step>
  <Step><b>External Network</b>: Select the external network providing internet connectivity</Step>
  <Step><b>Availability Zone Hints</b>: By default set to <b>Nova</b></Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The external network provides the internet connectivity for your instances through this router.

### Step 6: Set Gateway

Now configure the gateway for internet access:

<Steps>
  <Step>Locate your newly created router in the router list</Step>
  <Step>Click on <b>Set Gateway</b> on the right-hand side of the created router</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 7: Configure Gateway

<Steps>
  <Step>Select the <b>External Network</b> for internet connectivity</Step>
  <Step>Confirm the gateway configuration</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Once the gateway is set, your router is ready to provide internet connectivity to connected networks.

## Router Successfully Created

Your network router is now configured and ready to provide connectivity between your networks and the internet. Instances connected to router-enabled networks will have external access.

<Info>
To connect multiple network interfaces to this router, refer to the <b>How to Connect Multiple Interfaces</b> guide.

## Router Use Cases and Benefits

### **Common Router Applications:**
- **Internet access** - Provide external connectivity for private networks
- **Multi-network connectivity** - Connect different subnets and VLANs
- **Traffic routing** - Direct network traffic between different network segments
- **Gateway services** - Act as entry point for external communications

### **Router Configuration Best Practices:**
- **Plan network topology** before creating multiple routers
- **Use descriptive names** for easy identification and management
- **Monitor interface utilization** to ensure optimal performance
- **Implement security groups** to control traffic flow

<Warning>
Proper router configuration is essential for network security and performance. Misconfigured routers can lead to connectivity issues or security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

## Network Topology Considerations

### **Single Router Setup:**
- **Simple topology** - One router connecting internal network to internet
- **Use case**: Small deployments, development environments
- **Benefit**: Easy to manage and configure

### **Multi-Router Setup:**
- **Complex topology** - Multiple routers for different network segments
- **Use case**: Large deployments, production environments with multiple tiers
- **Benefit**: Better traffic isolation and redundancy

<Tip>
Start with a simple router configuration and expand as your network requirements grow.
